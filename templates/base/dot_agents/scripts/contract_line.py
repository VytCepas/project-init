"""Run a test runner and end with the test contract's line (rule 3; #1054).

    contract_line.py <suite> <bun|go|cargo> -- <runner argv ...>

The runner's output passes through (stderr folded into stdout), then the last
line is ``<suite>: N passed, M failed`` and the exit code is the runner's own,
so a fleet runner can add the numbers up. A skip counts in neither.

- bun: the closing ``N pass`` / ``N fail`` block before ``Ran N tests``; an
  ``N error`` line counts as failed. A test's own ``100 pass`` output is not counted.
- go: run it as ``go test -json``. Top-level tests are counted (a subtest's
  result already decides its parent's), and the output printed is go's plain
  form: package lines, plus the log of each test and subtest that failed.
- cargo: every harness ``test result:`` line (lib, each test binary, doc-tests)
  is summed; one inside a failing test's captured output is not.

A run that never reaches its tests (a build error) prints ``0 passed, 0 failed``
beside a non-zero exit, which the contract reads as a run that did not finish.
Stdlib only.
